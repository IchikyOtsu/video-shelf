# Shelf

A calm YouTube library with embedded playback, live channel search, channel filters, and saved/viewed videos.

## Database (Vercel + Neon)

This app uses Postgres through Drizzle. The schema supports users, sources, imported items, and per-user reading state.

1. Import the repository in Vercel.
2. In the project dashboard open **Storage** → **Create Database** → **Neon**, then connect it to this project. Vercel adds `DATABASE_URL` automatically.
3. Locally run `npm i -g vercel && vercel link`, then `vercel env pull .env.local`.
4. Add a long random `AUTH_SECRET` in Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables (for example: `openssl rand -base64 32`).
5. Create and apply migrations with `npm run db:generate && npm run db:migrate`.

Alternatively run `vercel integration add neon` interactively from the project folder.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
```

Authentication uses secure HTTP-only session cookies and password hashes. YouTube subscriptions and imported videos are stored in Postgres. Saved/viewed choices are stored per account in the current browser.

## YouTube experience

Search by channel name, @handle, or channel URL. Search waits 400 ms after typing and cancels outdated requests. Selecting a result imports the channel’s latest RSS videos. The library displays the 100 most recent imported videos.

Optionally configure `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` with YouTube Data API v3 enabled for channel name search. Without it, the app reads public YouTube search results; YouTube can block these requests or change the page format. If search is unavailable, the dialog suggests a direct handle or channel URL.

Videos play in a YouTube privacy-enhanced embed after a click. Videos whose owners disable embedding can be opened with the YouTube link below the player.

## Automatic YouTube refresh

Vercel calls `/api/cron/sync` once per day at 08:00 UTC. Add a `CRON_SECRET` environment variable in Vercel (a different random value from `AUTH_SECRET`). Vercel sends this secret automatically to the Cron route.
